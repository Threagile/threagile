# NOTE:
#
# For a perfect editing experience within your IDE of choice you can easily
# get model syntax validation and autocompletion (very handy for enum values)
# as well as live templates: Just import the schema.json into your IDE and assign
# it as "schema" to each Threagile YAML file. Also try to import individual parts
# from the live-templates.txt file into your IDE as live editing templates.
#
# You might also want to try the REST API when running in server mode...


# This is only a stub for simple quick editing and is not complete.
# For a complete usable example model see the "-create-example-model" option.

# NOTE:
# For risk tracking each risk-id needs to be defined (the string with the @ sign in it). These unique risk IDs
# are visible in the PDF report (the small grey string under each risk), the Excel (column "ID"), as well as the JSON responses.
# Some risk IDs have only one @ sign in them, while others multiple. The idea is to allow for unique but still speaking IDs.
# Therefore each risk instance creates its individual ID by taking all affected elements causing the risk to be within an @-delimited part.
# Using wildcards (the * sign) for parts delimited by @ signs allows to handle groups of certain risks at once. Best is to lookup the IDs
# to use in the created Excel file. Alternatively a model macro "seed-risk-tracking" is available that helps in initially
# seeding the risk tracking part here based on already identified and not yet handled risks.

  unencrypted-asset@some-component: # wildcards "*" between the @ characters are possible
    status: accepted # values: unchecked, in-discussion, accepted, in-progress, mitigated, false-positive
