# NOTE:
# This input file is to test for stored identifying data rule.
# Threshold count for detecting Quasi Direct Identifiers (QDI) is 5. 
# This test input file checks for 4 conditions:
# 1. Presence of 5 QDIs (Datastore A) - One risk
# 2. Presence of a PI and 4 QDI (Datastore B, technology: file-store) - One risk
# 3. No DI or QDI present (Datastore C) - No risk
# 4. Presence of DI and QDI (Datastore D) - One risk with both DI and QDI printed
# 5. One non-persistent storage storing DI and QDI - No risk as rule only talks about persistent storage

#
# For a perfect editing experience within your IDE of choice you can easily
# get model syntax validation and autocompletion (very handy for enum values)
# as well as live templates: Just import the schema.json into your IDE and assign
# it as "schema" to each Threagile YAML file. Also try to import individual parts
# from the live-templates.txt file into your IDE as live editing templates.
#
# You might also want to try the REST API when running in server mode...
