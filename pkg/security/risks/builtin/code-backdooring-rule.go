		Id:    "code-backdooring",
		Title: "Code Backdooring",
		Description: "For each build-pipeline component Code Backdooring risks might arise where attackers compromise the build-pipeline " +
			"in order to let backdoored artifacts be shipped into production. Aside from direct code backdooring this includes " +
			"backdooring of dependencies and even of more lower-level build infrastructure, like backdooring compilers (similar to what the XcodeGhost malware did) or dependencies.",
		Impact: "If this risk remains unmitigated, attackers might be able to execute code on and completely takeover " +
			"production environments.",
		ASVS:       "V10 - Malicious Code Verification Requirements",
		CheatSheet: "https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerable_Dependency_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html",
		Action:     "Build Pipeline Hardening",
		Mitigation: "Reduce the attack surface of backdooring the build pipeline by not directly exposing the build pipeline " +
			"components on the public internet and also not exposing it in front of unmanaged (out-of-scope) developer clients." +
			"Also consider the use of code signing to prevent code modifications.",
		Check:    "Are recommendations from the linked cheat sheet and referenced ASVS chapter applied?",
		Function: types.Operations,
		STRIDE:   types.Tampering,
		DetectionLogic: "In-scope development relevant technical assets which are either accessed by out-of-scope unmanaged " +
			"developer clients and/or are directly accessed by any kind of internet-located (non-VPN) component or are themselves directly located " +
			"on the internet.",
		RiskAssessment: "The risk rating depends on the confidentiality and integrity rating of the code being handled and deployed " +
			"as well as the placement/calling of this technical asset on/from the internet.", // TODO also take the CIA rating of the deployment targets (and their data) into account?
		FalsePositives: "When the build-pipeline and sourcecode-repo is not exposed to the internet and considered fully " +
			"trusted (which implies that all accessing clients are also considered fully trusted in terms of their patch management " +
			"and applied hardening, which must be equivalent to a managed developer client environment) this can be considered a false positive " +
			"after individual review.",
		ModelFailurePossibleReason: false,
		CWE:                        912,
