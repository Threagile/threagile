		Mitigation: "Use separate runtime environments for running different target components or apply similar separation styles to " +
			"prevent load- or breach-related problems originating from one more attacker-facing asset impacts also the " +
			"other more critical rated backend/datastore assets.",
		Check:    "Are recommendations from the linked cheat sheet and referenced ASVS chapter applied?",

			"Also mixing backend/datastore with frontend components on the same shared runtime is considered a risk.",
		RiskAssessment: "The risk rating (low or medium) depends on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability rating of " +
