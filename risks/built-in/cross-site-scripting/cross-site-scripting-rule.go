			"of the overall risk level take other applications running on the same domain into account as well.",
		Impact:     "If this risk remains unmitigated, attackers might be able to access individual victim sessions and steal or modify user data.",
		ASVS:       "V5 - Validation, Sanitization and Encoding Verification Requirements",
		CheatSheet: "https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html",
		Action:     "XSS Prevention",
		Mitigation: "Try to encode all values sent back to the browser and also handle DOM-manipulations in a safe way " +
			"to avoid DOM-based XSS. " +
			"When a third-party product is used instead of custom developed software, check if the product applies the proper mitigation and ensure a reasonable patch-level.",
		Check:          "Are recommendations from the linked cheat sheet and referenced ASVS chapter applied?",
		Function:       model.Development,
		STRIDE:         model.Tampering,
		DetectionLogic: "In-scope web applications.",
		RiskAssessment: "The risk rating depends on the sensitivity of the data processed in the web application.",
		FalsePositives: "When the technical asset " +
			"is not accessed via a browser-like component (i.e not by a human user initiating the request that " +
			"gets passed through all components until it reaches the web application) this can be considered a false positive.",
